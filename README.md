# super-minimal
Designing such programming language is much more complex than it seems. This repo contains the choices made in its design, highlighting the compromises, reasons, and objectives considered.  
The repo is public to receive everyone's opinion, so **feel free to open an issue and make your suggestion!**

## Design principles
There are 3 key design principles that have to be respected in each choice taken:
1) 📐🧱 Minimalism (and so modular)
2) 🤩🎇 Great user experience (and so modern)
3) 🤓📚 Stick to math, unless there is a good reason not to (and so functional)
